The owner's information about his career as a programmer and web developer is all included in this simple website.

This is his ***first time*** developing a website. That's why copying the source code from this repository (of this website) is not appropriate.

## Software Description

This is a Website developed with Full Static Files containing __HTML__, __CSS__, __Images__ (JPG, PNG) and __Icons__ (SVG, ICO).

## Description

1. The Logo of the website emphasizes __RGB__ (Red, Green, Blue) and the name of the owner.

2. The Footer specifies the addresses, social medias, and copyright owner of the owner for some informational purposes.

3. In the Home Section, the name and picture of the owner of this Website are present. There is a button below the Name,
written _Hire Me_. Clicking it would redirect the control to Email App. The back of the picture of the owner of the website shows the Primary
Programming Language the owner uses in his Programming Career.

4. The Services Section showcases the services offered by the owner as a Programmer, with proof of every service.

5. The Projects Section lists the Projects the owner has worked on, including the project's metadata and pictures. But these are just a few Projects the owner created just to showcase his ability to develop.

6. The About Me Section introduces the owner of the website. This section is formalized like a Resume/CV.
On the _Education Part_ and _Experience Part_, when a card is clicked, the control will redirect to the Education or Experience Sections, respectively, with whole new composition of some parts of the website but the same theme.
